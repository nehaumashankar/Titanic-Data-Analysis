## Overview:
The Titanic dataset provides insights into passengers aboard the Titanic, aiming to predict their survival based on factors like Age, Fare, Pclass, and Family Size.

## Approach:
This documentation guides through building a machine learning model for accurate classification, covering tasks like importing datasets, exploring features, data preprocessing, and model selection using metrics like accuracy and precision. Feature engineering, such as modifying "FamilySize," is highlighted for improved predictions.

## Findings:
Analysis reveals notable correlations - females and adults had higher survival rates, while third-class passengers fared better. Strategies like imputing missing data and choosing SVM as the optimal classifier contribute to model performance.

## Recommendations:
Consider ensemble methods like Gradient or XG Boost, fine-tune hyperparameters, and employ techniques like SHAP or LIME for further insights. Expanding data sources, like historical weather records, can enhance accuracy and understanding.
